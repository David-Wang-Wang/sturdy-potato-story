He was running across the empty and dark corridor. Something was chasing him, but he had no time to turn around.
At the end of the corridor, there was a door left ajar, with some light coming out of it. He sprinted and push the door open.

> Here you go sir, the files.
>> Great Will, now we can actually make progress.
> I'm sorry for what had happened...
>> Nah, what had been done was done, you can leave now.

He turned back to see the corridor, but something was wrong, there was no corridor. However, he was sweating; he was sure we was running a few seconds ago.
Maybe he was just running because he needed to deliver those files, he thought to himself.

>> Hey, you all good there bud?
> What? Robert?
>> No, I'm dad.
> Oh go fuck yourself Robert.
>> Bro, why so angry? Come on.

Ignoring him, he looked around for the exit. But all there was was a plain concrete wall. "Am I going crazy?" he muttered to himself.
