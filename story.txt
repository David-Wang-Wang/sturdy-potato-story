He was running across the empty and dark corridor. Something was chasing him, but he had no time to turn around.
At the end of the corridor, there was a door left ajar, with some light coming out of it. He sprinted and push the door open.

> Here you go sir, the files.
>> Great Will, now we can actually make progress.
> I'm sorry for what had happened...
>> Nah, what had been done was done, you can leave now.

He turned back to see the corridor, but something was wrong, there was no corridor. However, he was sweating; he was sure we was running a few seconds ago.
Maybe he was just running because he needed to deliver those files, he thought to himself.

>> Hey, you all good there bud?
> What? Robert?
>> No, I'm dad.
> Oh go fuck yourself Robert.
>> Bro, why so angry? Come on.

Ignoring him, he looked around for the exit. But all there was was a plain concrete wall. "Am I going crazy?" he muttered to himself.
The walls started to move in. They slowly moved in, only a few millimeters every second. His vision continued to go in and out, as the walls moved more and more in.
He muttered under his breath, "What is going on?", his breathing slowed down. The spots in his vision grew in size. And suddenly, the walls moved back to their
original location. The door was back, and he ran for the door quickly. The door was locked.
 
...Two nurses started over the patient as he trashed about in his bed. "Not 
again," muttered one nurse. "How long has he been in a coma," asked the other.
"Going on five years now," replied the first nurse. "And how long since the
fits have started?" "Only one, but there's been a new development. He's 
started muttering for the files." "Oh, you mean the ones he was admitted
with?" "Yes. Unfortunetly they didn't help us identify him."  The two nurses
sighed as they slowly walked away.
